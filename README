This is my 1st api made using flask.

It is hosted in render:-
url: https://youtube-fqmk.onrender.com/

routes are :-
/:
    This is the main route of the site. It returns simple webpage which uses /youtube route to show videos.
    It takes a optional argument 'q' which is only a search term for youtube.

/youtube:
    This is the api itself. This is very simple api. It returns only image source and video ID. It takes a optional argument 'q' which is search term.
    It returns JSON as :-
        [
            {
                "img":IMAGE_SOURCE,
                "video":VIDEO_ID
            },
            {
                "img":IMAGE_SOURCE,
                "video":VIDEO_ID
            }
            ...
        ]

/source:
    This is redirects you to https://www.youtube.com

/watch:
    This route returns a webpage that plays youtube embed video. This takes a compulsory argument 'vid' which has video ID. If vid argument is not provided it will redirect to '/' route.
